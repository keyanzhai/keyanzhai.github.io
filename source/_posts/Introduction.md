# About me

My name is Keyan Zhai, or 翟珂岩 in Chinese. You can call me KZ for short.

I got my Master's degree in Robotics from University of Pennsylvania in May 2023. 

# Research

My research interests lie at the intersection of Computer Vision, Computer Graphics and Robotics, with a focus on the perception, representation, and understanding of the 3D world. 

I am particularly excited about the following topics:

- **Perception**: state estimation, sensor fusion, visual odometry, visual SLAM, structure from motion, egocentric vision
- **Representation**: 3D/4D reconstruction, neural scene representation, neural rendering, image synthesis
- **Understanding**: 3D scene understanding, point cloud analysis, instance/semantic segmentation, pose estimation

My ultimate aim is to digitize humans, objects and events in the physical world and explore their applications in industries like AR/VR, autonomous driving and Robotics.
