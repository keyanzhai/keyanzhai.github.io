# About me

My name is Keyan Zhai, or 翟珂岩 in Chinese. You can call me KZ for short.

I got my Master's degree in Robotics from University of Pennsylvania in May 2023. 

# Research

My research interests lie at the intersection of Computer Vision, Computer Graphics and Robotics, with a focus on the perception, modeling, and understanding of the 3D world. 

I am particularly excited about the following topics:

- **Perception**: state estimation, sensor fusion, visual odometry, visual SLAM, structure from motion
- **Modeling**: 3D/4D reconstruction, neural scene representation, neural rendering, image synthesis
- **Understanding**: 3D scene understanding, semantic segmentation, object detection and tracking, pose estimation

My ultimate aim is to digitize humans, objects and events in the physical world and explore their applications in industries like AR/VR, autonomous driving and Robotics.
