# Research Interest

My research interest lies in the intersection of CV, CG and Robotics. I’m particularly interested in the topics of **3D reconstruction**, **neural rendering**, **sensor fusion**, etc. My research goal is to achieve high-quality 3D reconstruction and photorealistic rendering, with the aim of exploring their applications in industries like AR/VR and Robotics.
